description: Validated design decisions, CSS patterns, and visual direction for the live-execution UX (run-card frame + tool-call panel + long-run composition). Auto-loaded during UI implementation on the Agentic RAG project. Use when building or refactoring ToolCallPanel, StreamsProvider, MessageItem, or any chat-surface component that touches the agent's mid-execution moment.

## Project: Agentic RAG

**Design direction:** Calm instrument with selective signal-density at the live moment. Aether Deep Midnight palette (mirrored from `frontend/src/index.css :.dark`). Restrained motion (brand-pulse on the working avatar, progress shimmer on the active run, status pills that fade in/out). The chrome stays out of the way until it has something to say — then it speaks clearly.

**Reference points** (north stars during ideation):
- **Claude.ai analysis tool** — inline tool-result-in-conversation pattern
- **Cursor / Windsurf agent mode** — multi-step agent loop with collapsible tool calls
- **Linear** — calm-but-expressive motion language
- **Raycast** — instrument feel; monospace touches, dense-but-quiet

**Acceptance bar:** the **long execution in progress** moment — 30+ seconds into a multi-tool run. Can the user instantly read what the agent did, what it's doing, and trust it's still on track? This directly addresses the documented lived-experience UAT-gap pattern (regressions hiding in slow streams).

## Overall Direction

- **Palette:** Aether Deep Midnight — every token (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-primary`, etc.) mirrors the live `frontend/src/index.css :.dark` values. See `sources/themes/default.css`.
- **Typography:** Inter (body), Manrope (headlines), JetBrains Mono (code + status + identifiers).
- **Spacing:** 4px grid (`--space-1` through `--space-16`).
- **Shapes:** softer radii — `--radius-md: 10px` (matches app), `--radius-lg: 14px` for outer run-cards.
- **Motion:** purposeful — `brandPulse` (1.5s) on active bot avatar, `progressShimmer` (1.8s) on active run, `dotBounce` (1.4s) on status pills, `fadeSlideUp` (0.3s) on new content. No decorative spin.
- **Layout approach:** single-column conversation, no dedicated execution rail. Live runs occupy explicit bracketed Run-Card containers in the conversation flow.
- **Interaction patterns:** sticky run-card header, Focus Mode (past steps fold to result-summary, active step gets full editor), click-to-expand by default, explicit `Next: ...` footer, fold-to-summary on completion.

## Tool-Call Architecture

`execute_code` renders as a real editor pane (line gutter, syntax highlighting, lang chip) with labeled STDOUT/STDERR regions and file outputs as inline preview cards. Different tool types (`search_documents`, `read_file`, etc.) get their own inner content shape inside the **same outer frame**. The outer container is one component; the inner body is selected by tool name.

## Design Areas

| Area | Reference | Key Decision |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Live-Run Container | [references/live-run-container.md](references/live-run-container.md) | Bracketed Run-Card in conversation flow, sticky header (timer + counter), Focus Mode collapses past steps to result-summary, explicit Next-up footer, folds to one-line summary on completion |
| Tool-Call Panel | [references/tool-call-panel.md](references/tool-call-panel.md) | Editor-inset shape for `execute_code` (gutter + syntax + lang chip), labeled STDOUT/STDERR regions, file outputs lift to preview cards, **different inner shapes per tool inside the same outer frame** |

## Theme

The winning theme file is at [sources/themes/default.css](sources/themes/default.css). Tokens are direct mirrors of `frontend/src/index.css :.dark` — so transitioning sketches to React code should be a straight port, not a rebuild.

## Source Files

Original sketch HTML files are preserved in `sources/` for complete reference. Each contains all variants (winners + alternatives) so you can re-feel the rejected paths if a question reopens.

- [sources/001-stream-framing/](sources/001-stream-framing/) — winner: C (Run-Card)
- [sources/002-tool-call-panel/](sources/002-tool-call-panel/) — winner: C (Editor Inset)
- [sources/003-thinking-moment/](sources/003-thinking-moment/) — winner: B (Focus Mode)

## When to Apply These Findings

Load and apply this skill when:

- Building or refactoring `frontend/src/components/chat/ToolCallPanel.tsx` (G-5 hot file — 5+ historical touches)
- Building or refactoring `frontend/src/providers/StreamsProvider.tsx` (G-5 hot file)
- Building or refactoring `frontend/src/components/chat/MessageItem.tsx` or `frontend/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`
- Adding a new tool to the agent (you'll need a new per-tool inner body component — see `references/tool-call-panel.md` D2)
- Designing the UI for any phase tagged `chat`, `streaming`, `agent-loop`, `tool-call`, `live-execution`, or `provider-ux`
- Reviewing UI work against the "lived-experience UAT-gap" rule (CLAUDE.md guardrail G-4)

Skip when:

- Working on non-chat surfaces (settings, document library, skill studio, auth)
- Working on backend-only changes (no UI touch)
