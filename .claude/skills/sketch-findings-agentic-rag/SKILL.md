description: Validated design decisions, CSS patterns, and visual direction for the agent's live-execution UX AND the right-side workspace panel (run-card frame + tool-call panel + long-run composition + panel shell, file/diff viewer, ask_user interrupt, chat↔panel seam). Auto-loaded during UI implementation on the Agentic RAG project. Use when building or refactoring ToolCallPanel, StreamsProvider, MessageItem, useMessages, the Phase 087 workspace panel, or any chat-surface component that touches the agent's mid-execution moment.

## Project: Agentic RAG

**Design direction:** Calm instrument with selective signal-density at the live moment. Aether Deep Midnight palette (mirrored from `frontend/src/index.css :.dark`). Restrained motion (brand-pulse on the working avatar, progress shimmer on the active run, status pills that fade in/out). The chrome stays out of the way until it has something to say — then it speaks clearly.

**Reference points** (north stars during ideation):
- **Claude.ai analysis tool** — inline tool-result-in-conversation pattern
- **Cursor / Windsurf agent mode** — multi-step agent loop with collapsible tool calls
- **Linear** — calm-but-expressive motion language
- **Raycast** — instrument feel; monospace touches, dense-but-quiet

**Acceptance bar:** the **long execution in progress** moment — 30+ seconds into a multi-tool run. Can the user instantly read what the agent did, what it's doing, and trust it's still on track? This directly addresses the documented lived-experience UAT-gap pattern (regressions hiding in slow streams).

**Sketch sessions wrapped:** 2026-05-24 (live-execution UX — sketches 001–003), 2026-05-29 (workspace panel — sketches 004–007)

## Overall Direction

- **Palette:** Aether Deep Midnight — every token (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-primary`, etc.) mirrors the live `frontend/src/index.css :.dark` values. See `sources/themes/default.css`.
- **Typography:** Inter (body), Manrope (headlines), JetBrains Mono (code + status + identifiers).
- **Spacing:** 4px grid (`--space-1` through `--space-16`).
- **Shapes:** softer radii — `--radius-md: 10px` (matches app), `--radius-lg: 14px` for outer run-cards.
- **Motion:** purposeful — `brandPulse` (1.5s) on active bot avatar, `progressShimmer` (1.8s) on active run, `dotBounce` (1.4s) on status pills, `fadeSlideUp` (0.3s) on new content. No decorative spin.
- **Layout approach:** single-column conversation, no dedicated execution rail. Live runs occupy explicit bracketed Run-Card containers in the conversation flow.
- **Interaction patterns:** sticky run-card header, Focus Mode (past steps fold to result-summary, active step gets full editor), click-to-expand by default, explicit `Next: ...` footer, fold-to-summary on completion.

## Tool-Call Architecture

`execute_code` renders as a real editor pane (line gutter, syntax highlighting, lang chip) with labeled STDOUT/STDERR regions and file outputs as inline preview cards. Different tool types (`search_documents`, `read_file`, etc.) get their own inner content shape inside the **same outer frame**. The outer container is one component; the inner body is selected by tool name.

## Workspace Panel (Phase 087)

The right-side workspace panel makes the agent's work **visible and interactive** without breaking the calm-instrument promise:

- **Push/split, never overlay.** A three-column CSS grid (`52px` nav · `1fr` chat · `30%` panel) shrinks the chat; the panel never floats over the conversation. Collapse animates the column to a thin rail (with count badges) or fully away. Mobile (<768px) = bottom-sheet. Toggle: header button + `⌘.`/`Ctrl+.`.
- **Stacked-accordion sections.** Four collapsible areas in one scroll — Todos · Files · Pending question · Versions — with a pending `ask_user` pinned at the very top. Empty (the common case) short-circuits to one calm empty state, never four empty headers.
- **Panel = now, chat = happened.** The single mental model that governs the seam: the panel reconciles to current state on reload (no history replay); the chat is the durable record. Panel-owned tools (`write_todos`/`workspace_write`/`ask_user`) render as quiet pointers in chat while live, and resolve to self-contained cards on reload.
- **Calm-loud interrupts.** `ask_user` blocks the whole agent loop, so the block is made unmissable *structurally* (paused amber run-card + locked composer + pulsing toggle dot) rather than by hijacking the screen.
- **Color language carries forward:** amber = needs-you / paused, green = done / answered / diff-added, red = diff-removed / base-version, primary = live / pointer. Same Aether Deep Midnight tokens throughout.

## Design Areas

**Live-execution UX (sketches 001–003):**

| Area | Reference | Key Decision |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Live-Run Container | [references/live-run-container.md](references/live-run-container.md) | Bracketed Run-Card in conversation flow, sticky header (timer + counter), Focus Mode collapses past steps to result-summary, explicit Next-up footer, folds to one-line summary on completion |
| Tool-Call Panel | [references/tool-call-panel.md](references/tool-call-panel.md) | Editor-inset shape for `execute_code` (gutter + syntax + lang chip), labeled STDOUT/STDERR regions, file outputs lift to preview cards, **different inner shapes per tool inside the same outer frame** |

**Workspace panel UX (sketches 004–007, Phase 087):**

| Area | Reference | Key Decision |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Panel Shell & Navigation | [references/panel-shell.md](references/panel-shell.md) | Push/split three-column grid (no overlay), stacked-accordion sections, collapse-to-rail with count badges, empty-state short-circuit, mobile bottom-sheet, `⌘.` toggle |
| File Browser & Diff Viewer | [references/file-browser-and-diff.md](references/file-browser-and-diff.md) | Full-replace drill-in preview (reuse MarkdownRenderer + syntax highlight + graceful fallback), in-column unified `+/−` diff, opt-in `⤢` wide overlay (never auto-widen), red-base/green-target version picker |
| Pending Question (ask_user) | [references/pending-question.md](references/pending-question.md) | Dual-surface (calm pinned panel card + chat pointer cue), structural loudness (paused amber run-card + locked composer + toggle dot), always-present free-text, resume-in-place, graceful timeout |
| Chat ↔ Panel Seam | [references/chat-panel-seam.md](references/chat-panel-seam.md) | Panel=now / chat=happened; live quiet-pointers for the 3 panel-owned tools, reload-resolved self-contained cards (closes the `ask_user` reload gap), single source of truth |

## Theme

The winning theme file is at [sources/themes/default.css](sources/themes/default.css). Tokens are direct mirrors of `frontend/src/index.css :.dark` — so transitioning sketches to React code should be a straight port, not a rebuild.

## Source Files

Original sketch HTML files are preserved in `sources/` for complete reference. Each contains all variants (winners + alternatives) so you can re-feel the rejected paths if a question reopens.

- [sources/001-stream-framing/](sources/001-stream-framing/) — winner: C (Run-Card)
- [sources/002-tool-call-panel/](sources/002-tool-call-panel/) — winner: C (Editor Inset)

## When to Apply These Findings

Load and apply this skill when:

- Building or refactoring `frontend/src/components/chat/ToolCallPanel.tsx` (G-5 hot file — 5+ historical touches)
- Building or refactoring `frontend/src/providers/StreamsProvider.tsx` (G-5 hot file)
- Building or refactoring `frontend/src/components/chat/MessageItem.tsx` or `frontend/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`
- Adding a new tool to the agent (you'll need a new per-tool inner body component — see `references/tool-call-panel.md` D2)
- Designing the UI for any phase tagged `chat`, `streaming`, `agent-loop`, `tool-call`, `live-execution`, or `provider-ux`
- Reviewing UI work against the "lived-experience UAT-gap" rule (CLAUDE.md guardrail G-4)

**Workspace panel (Phase 087) — load when:**

- Building the right-side workspace panel shell, its collapse/rail/mobile behavior, or the section accordion (`references/panel-shell.md`)
- Building the file browser, file preview, or version-diff viewer in the panel (`references/file-browser-and-diff.md`)
- Building the `ask_user` pending-question UI, the paused/locked-composer treatment, or answer-and-resume (`references/pending-question.md`)
- Adding chat renderers for `write_todos` / `workspace_write` / `ask_user`, or anything touching the live-vs-reload transcript boundary (`references/chat-panel-seam.md`)
- Working on any phase tagged `panel`, `workspace`, `ask_user`, `diff`, `files`, or `seam`

Skip when:

- Working on non-chat, non-panel surfaces (settings, document library, skill studio, auth)
- Working on backend-only changes (no UI touch)
