- ✅ **v3.0 Document Management** — Phases 110-119 (shipped 2026-06-21). SEED-005 Tier A as a first-class product surface: DM Foundations → metadata enrichment + multi-provider embeddings → metadata-driven views / "virtual folders" → document relationships → auto-classification → governance health. 24/24 functional requirements delivered.
- ✅ **v3.1 Workflow & Skill Studio — Trust, Clarity & Triggers** — Phases 120-129 (CORE 120-124+123.1; STRETCH 127-129 shipped; 125/126/130/131 deferred) (shipped 2026-06-28). Collision fix + context isolation · cross-provider trust/honesty parity · Skill Trigger Tuner · Workflow Studio soul + strict↔loose · chat tool-card unification + provider logos · MiniMax/OpenRouter arg repair.
- ✅ **v3.2 Skill Eval Studio + Self-Improving** — Phases 132-145 (CORE 132-137 + inserts 134.1/137.1/137.2; STRETCH 138-143+145 shipped; 144/FILE-01 deferred → v3.3) (shipped 2026-07-10). Skill Eval Studio (eval persistence + versions + with-vs-without runner + honest verdicts + ratings + self-improve loop + publish gate + Evals panel) · built-in skill-creator · STRETCH honesty phases · run-lifecycle foundation (FND-01) · Starter Workflow Library (WF-01).
- ✅ **v3.3 Operator UX** — Phases 146-159 (shipped 2026-07-18). Operator/admin tier (gated /admin Control Room + governance) + dynamic model-registry/discovery + secrets-at-rest + workflow/agent file-inputs + inline citations + plain-language + WCAG-AA + deployment presets/install wizard. 20/20 requirements delivered.
- ✅ **v3.4 Multi-Tenancy & Org Access** — Phases 160-168 CORE (shipped 2026-07-22); STRETCH 169-173 deferred → carry-forward guide `.planning/v3.4-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`. The load-bearing **one-way RLS door**: membership-based tenancy (Tenancy ADR → org/dept/role schema → personal-org backfill → the atomic RLS + user-JWT-client-swap crux → SECDEF audit + two-org isolation suite → `is_global` retirement → org-admin shell/switcher → invitations/roles/greenlists → SAML SSO). Migrations 104-113.
- ✅ **v3.5 UX Consolidation & Chat Polish** — Phases 174-177 CORE (shipped 2026-07-23); STRETCH 178-180 deferred → carry-forward guide `.planning/v3.5-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`. Cleared the load-bearing chat-surface bug backlog + consolidated the accumulated UI/UX (incl. the new v3.4 org surfaces) into one coherent, honest experience: run-state & lifecycle honesty (174) · cross-provider streaming fidelity (175) · chat render correctness + exec reliability (176) · v3.4 org-surface family-cohesion polish (177). 14/14 CORE requirements delivered; no migration. Full detail archived: `.planning/milestones/v3.5-ROADMAP.md`.
- ✅ **v3.6 Visual / No-Code Workflow Studio** ([[SEED-123]]) — Phases **181-189 CORE + 190 STRETCH** (shipped 2026-08-09, git tag `v3.6`); STRETCH **191 deferred** → carry-forward guide `.planning/v3.6-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`. Inserts 184.1 / 188.1 / 188.2. A drag-and-drop node-canvas authoring + non-technical live-run-observability layer ON TOP of the existing governed harness engine (build-on-not-rewrite; `@xyflow/react` v12, the milestone's one net-new dep). **The differentiator shipped: graded governance** — strict-when-KB-grounded / flexible-when-open per node, structurally enforced at RUN time rather than authoring time, which is the category white-space the Beam/Glean/n8n deep crawl found none of them covering. **The D-14 red line held across all 13 phases — 7 harness executors at close, exactly as at open; the canvas never became a second runtime.** HARD gates: #1 revert-at-any-time ✅ (`test_revert_byte_identical`) · #2 study-and-beat ✅ · #3 connector story **⚠ CORE half ✅ (CONN-01), live half ⅓** — a real Slack message sends through the full governed path, but Jira and email are not drivable from a workflow (`D-190-DEF-17` → connections milestone, SEED-146). **20/24 requirements satisfied · 2 partial · 1 unsatisfied (CONN-02) · 1 deferred (SCALE-01);** CORE closed 19/21 satisfied with **zero unsatisfied**. Migrations 114-118. Full detail archived: `.planning/milestones/v3.6-ROADMAP.md`.
- 🚧 **v3.7 Workflow Product Completion** — Phases **192-198** (opened 2026-08-10). Makes the workflow product built across v2.8→v3.6 usable end to end. **Not new capability — completion.** Ten of the fourteen findings behind it were seeds the operator planted during earlier UAT and that were never scheduled; this milestone schedules them. Ingestion (SEED-149/150) → v3.8; connections (SEED-146, CONN-02) → after, deliberately, because safe outbound writes need RUN-01's stop control and NODE-02's human step.

## 🚧 Active: v3.7 Workflow Product Completion

**Goal:** an author can find a workflow, understand the door they are walking through, build it with
the right vocabulary, stop it, and see what it produced.

⚠ **Numbering starts at 192 — `191` is RESERVED** for the deferred canvas-scale phase
(`.planning/v3.6-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`). Do not reuse it.

| # | Phase | Goal | Requirements | SC |
|---|-------|------|--------------|-----|
| 192 | Workflow Library IA | The Workflows page can be searched, filtered and read at a glance, and its card actions are predictable | LIB-01…04 | 4 |
| 193 | Authoring Doors + Template Placement | A user can tell the two doors apart before choosing, and can find where to supply a template | AUTH-01, AUTH-03 | 3 |
| 194 | Stop a Running Workflow | A run can be stopped at any point and says so honestly | RUN-01 | 3 |
| 195 | Show the Deliverable | A workflow that produces a file shows it, reusing the shipped file presentation | RUN-02, RUN-03 | 3 |
| 196 | Registry-Backed Model Picker (canvas) | A step's model is chosen from the live registry, never typed | AUTH-04 | 3 |
| 197 | Guided Authoring | Drafting from a description guides the decisions that matter | AUTH-02 | 3 |
| 198 | Node Vocabulary (research-first) | Establish whether deterministic primitives earn their place, and cover structured mid-run input | NODE-01, NODE-02 | 3 |

**Build order rationale:** 192-195 are the four things that block *using* the product, cheapest and
most independent first — 194 in particular is mostly UI over an endpoint that already exists. 196 and
197 improve authoring quality once the surface is usable. **198 is last and is research-first by
construction** — SEED-141 requires proving the need before shipping a primitive, and `execute_code`
is the incumbent any proposal must beat.

### Phase Checklist

- [ ] **Phase 192: Workflow Library IA** — search, filter, at-a-glance cards, predictable card actions, findable create affordance (LIB-01…04)
- [ ] **Phase 193: Authoring Doors + Template Placement** — the two doors are tellable apart before choosing; template supply has a findable home (AUTH-01, AUTH-03)
- [ ] **Phase 194: Stop a Running Workflow** — a run can be stopped mid-execution and reports `cancelled` honestly (RUN-01)
- [ ] **Phase 195: Show the Deliverable** — a produced file is shown from the run surface, reusing the shipped file presentation (RUN-02, RUN-03)
- [ ] **Phase 196: Registry-Backed Model Picker (canvas)** — a step's model comes from the live registry, never typed (AUTH-04)
- [ ] **Phase 197: Guided Authoring** — drafting from a description guides the decisions that change the result (AUTH-02)
- [ ] **Phase 198: Node Vocabulary (research-first)** — prove the deterministic-primitive need before shipping one; cover structured mid-run input (NODE-01, NODE-02)

### Phase Details

> ⚠ **Format note (2026-08-10).** This section was rewritten from bold `**Phase NNN: …**` labels to
> `#### Phase NNN: …` headings. The GSD SDK resolves a phase with `#{2,4}\s*Phase\s+<n>\s*:`
> (`bin/lib/phase.cjs:221`); under the bold form **every** phase op for 192-198 returned
> `phase_found: false`, blocking `discuss-phase`, `plan-phase`, `execute-phase` and `progress`.
> No goal, requirement or success criterion was changed — only heading level and field structure.

#### Phase 192: Workflow Library IA

**Goal**: The Workflows page can be searched, filtered and read at a glance, and its card actions are predictable.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of the milestone; deliberately the most independent).
**Requirements**: LIB-01, LIB-02, LIB-03, LIB-04
**Flags**: **G-2 fires (visual)** — sketch before spec/discuss. SEED-136 re-open trigger #3 says the same: do the IA question FIRST, do not restyle underneath it. **G-5**: `WorkflowsPage.tsx` is not on the hot-file ledger — audit at discuss-time.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A user can find a named workflow by typing part of its name.
  2. A user can narrow the list without reading every card.
  3. A user can state what a card's actions will do before clicking one; "Tweak" no longer surprises.
  4. The create affordance is reachable without scrolling past the existing shelves.

**Plans**: 12 plans across 8 waves — `/gsd:execute-phase 192`

- [ ] `192-01-PLAN.md` (wave 1) — count-gate adoption: the five suites covering this page were in NEITHER knob (74 of 123 tests invisible). Must be commit 1.
- [ ] `192-02-PLAN.md` (wave 1) — D-04 backend: `is_mine` + `is_system_global` computed server-side on `/published` and `/starters`, never a raw `created_by`; the widened wire type.
- [ ] `192-03-PLAN.md` (wave 2) — `RunModal` characterization baseline, 6 states, captured while `library/RunModal.tsx` provably does not exist.
- [ ] `192-04-PLAN.md` (wave 2) — delete-Sheet characterization baseline, 7 states + the two graded-guard invariants; the real ≈169 L extent recorded.
- [ ] `192-05-PLAN.md` (wave 2) — the pure leaves: `libraryRow` · `libraryVocabulary` · `libraryFilter` (merge/dedupe-by-id/chips/substring search) + the F1/F4/F5 subtree fences.
- [ ] `192-06-PLAN.md` (wave 3) — D-01 move 1: `RunModal` out of the page, create-additively then cut, zero re-capture.
- [ ] `192-07-PLAN.md` (wave 3) — `LibraryToolbar`: create leads · always-on search · six counted chips · project select + the D-17 starters note · the updating marker.
- [ ] `192-08-PLAN.md` (wave 4) — D-01 move 2: `WorkflowDeleteSheet` out of `PublishedCard`, state + JSX as one unit, proved on the original render path.
- [ ] `192-09-PLAN.md` (wave 5) — `WorkflowCard` (159-C): one verb + `⋯`, the fork consequence as an `aria-describedby` contract, no `Publish…`, the D-18 draft delete.
- [ ] `192-10-PLAN.md` (wave 6) — the page becomes composition: `allSettled` merge, one flat list, shelves/rail/cards/banner deleted, four tests rewritten and two deleted with the one authorized pin lowering.
- [ ] `192-11-PLAN.md` (wave 7) — LIB-01…04 behaviour at 200 workflows: search, chip honesty, the carve-out, D-17, the D-04 cross-check, F2/F3 and create-first DOM order.
- [ ] `192-12-PLAN.md` (wave 8) — every fence driven RED against a real plant and restored md5-identical, the subtree delta MEASURED, all suites pinned, G-5 recorded satisfied, and the eleven G-4 UAT rows.

#### Phase 193: Authoring Doors + Template Placement

**Goal**: A user can tell the two authoring doors apart before choosing, and can find where to supply a template.
**Depends on**: Phase 192 (the library is the surface the doors are reached from).
**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-03
**Flags**: **G-2 fires.** AUTH-03 is placement and discoverability — the capability shipped in Phase 152; this is NOT a rebuild.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A person who has not seen the Builder can predict what each door does before clicking.
  2. The number of perceived choices does not increase (the 187 template-door lesson — seed the existing path, do not add a third).
  3. A user with a template to fill can find where to supply it.

**Plans**: TBD — `/gsd:plan-phase 193`

#### Phase 194: Stop a Running Workflow

**Goal**: A run can be stopped at any point and says so honestly.
**Depends on**: Nothing structural — mostly UI over an endpoint that already exists.
**Requirements**: RUN-01
**Flags**: Reuses the owned cancel endpoint + `run_lifecycle` internals — **this is not a new runtime path**. Hard prerequisite for the deferred scheduled/recurring-runs work (Phase 105 carry-forward).
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A user can stop a run mid-execution from the run surface.
  2. The stopped run reports `cancelled` honestly — not failed, not silently complete.
  3. Stopping is safe mid-phase: no partial write is presented as finished.

**Plans**: TBD — `/gsd:plan-phase 194`

#### Phase 195: Show the Deliverable

**Goal**: A workflow that produces a file shows it, reusing the shipped file presentation.
**Depends on**: Nothing structural — but see the measurement fence below; backend-vs-frontend scope is unknown until it is answered.
**Requirements**: RUN-02, RUN-03
**Flags**: ⚠ **First task is measurement** — establish whether a workflow run emits output files onto the wire at all (SEED-148 records this as explicitly unmeasured). RUN-03 exists specifically to forbid rebuilding output-file UI.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A completed workflow that produced a file shows that file from the run surface.
  2. The presentation reuses `OutputFileCard` / `FilesSection` / `fileIcon` — no second file UI.
  3. Multiple produced files are handled with the shipped hero/working split, not a new pattern.

**Plans**: TBD — `/gsd:plan-phase 195`

#### Phase 196: Registry-Backed Model Picker (canvas)

**Goal**: A step's model is chosen from the live registry, never typed.
**Depends on**: Nothing structural — the canvas surface it edits shipped in v3.6.
**Requirements**: AUTH-04
**Flags**: **Scope fence, deliberate** — the app-wide model single-source sweep (SEED-040 / SEED-088) is explicitly OUT; the canvas/workflow surface only.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A step's model is chosen from a list sourced from the live registry.
  2. An unregistered model cannot be silently selected — the pick-time honesty SEED-135 asks for.
  3. The app-wide sweep is NOT attempted; the canvas surface only.

**Plans**: TBD — `/gsd:plan-phase 196`

#### Phase 197: Guided Authoring

**Goal**: Drafting from a description guides the decisions that matter.
**Depends on**: Phase 193 (the doors must be legible before the fast door is deepened).
**Requirements**: AUTH-02
**Flags**: **G-2 fires.** D-05 red line — the fast door must stay fast; guidance must not turn "Describe & run" into the strict door.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A user drafting from a description is asked the decisions that change the result, rather than receiving a finished draft in one shot.
  2. The fast door stays fast — guidance must not turn "Describe & run" into the strict door (D-05).
  3. A user can still get a one-shot draft if they want one.

**Plans**: TBD — `/gsd:plan-phase 197`

#### Phase 198: Node Vocabulary (research-first)

**Goal**: Establish whether deterministic primitives earn their place, and cover structured mid-run input.
**Depends on**: Last by construction — SEED-141 requires proving the need before shipping a primitive, and `execute_code` is the incumbent any proposal must beat.
**Requirements**: NODE-01, NODE-02
**Flags**: **Research-first — NODE-01 may legitimately ship nothing.** Branching/looping stays OUT: the spine is LINEAR by design; any primitive must stay linear-compatible or the linear commitment is revisited as its own decision. **G-5 fires** on `backend/app/services/harness/phase_types.py` (35 commits / 14 phases) — a phase adding a SECOND concern to that file produces a refactor recommendation first.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. **Research output first:** count how many prompts in real workflows exist only to reshape data between two real steps. If the number is low, NODE-01 ships nothing and says so.
  2. Any primitive proposed answers three constraints explicitly: the spine is LINEAR, governance vocabulary assumes an AI step, and a node's face is computed from its config.
  3. Structured mid-run input is covered — starting from what `llm_human_input` already does, not from a blank form node.

**Plans**: TBD — `/gsd:plan-phase 198`

<summary>✅ <strong>v3.6 Visual / No-Code Workflow Studio</strong> (Phases 181-190) — SHIPPED 2026-08-09 · 13 phases · 151 plans · 1,064 commits · full detail in <code>.planning/milestones/v3.6-ROADMAP.md</code></summary>

**Goal:** a drag-and-drop, business-friendly visual authoring + live-run observability layer on top
of the existing governed harness workflow engine — so a non-technical user (Legal / HR / Finance)
can draw their own process and watch it run, without losing the engine's governance rails.

| Phase | Name | Plans | Outcome |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 181 | Revert Foundation | 3/3 | ✅ verify `passed` 12/12 — HARD gate #1 (`visual_workflow_canvas` + `test_revert_byte_identical`) |
| 182 | Server Validation Seam | 12/12 | ✅ `POST /workflows/validate` reusing `lint_workflow` verbatim. ⚠ SC#3 accepted risk → SEED-134 |
| 183 | Read-Only Canvas | 9/9 | ✅ verify `passed` 8/8 + live gate 7/7 — pure projection proved before any write complexity |
| 184 | Editable Canvas + Live Structural Validation | 13/13 | ✅ UAT 13/13, SECURED. ⚠ **no VERIFICATION.md** — 5 reqs ride on UAT |
| 184.1 | Builder Header Consolidation (INSERTED) | 1/1 | ✅ nyquist compliant. ⚠ no VERIFICATION.md (carries no requirement) |
| **185** | **Graded Governance — Grounding Mode + Action-Risk Dial** | 13/13 | ✅ **THE HEADLINE DIFFERENTIATOR.** verify 12/12, operator gate PASSED, SECURED 49/49 — the audit caught a real fail-open BLOCKER before close |
| 186 | Concurrency & Autosave | 20/20 | ✅ verify 9/9, operator UAT passed, SECURED |
| 187 | Business Vocabulary + AI-Seeded Canvas | 29/29 | ✅ verify 13/14, SECURED 152/152. ⚠ VOCAB-02 partial → SEED-133 |
| 188 | Non-Technical Run Observability | 13/13 | ✅ UAT 16 PASS / 0 FAIL, SECURED 46/46. ⚠ **no VERIFICATION.md** — 3 reqs ride on UAT |
| 188.1 | WorkflowCanvas Extraction Refactor (INSERTED) | 5/5 | ✅ verify 6/6 — canvas 1593 → 1292 L; G-5 debt paid |
| 188.2 | PhaseNodeCard Extraction Refactor (INSERTED) | 7/7 | ✅ verify 7/7 — card 797 → 274 L (−65.6%); DOM proved byte-identical |
| 189 | Governed External-Action Node Model | 16/16 | ✅ UAT pass, SECURED, CONN-01 delivered — HARD gate #3 CORE half. ⚠ **no VERIFICATION.md** |
| 190 | **(STRETCH)** Live Connector Slice + Connector Security | 19/19 | ⚠ **split verdict** — CONN-03 ✅ (`threats_open: 0`, real Slack send); **CONN-02 ✗** (1 of 3 connectors drivable) |
| 191 | **(STRETCH)** Conditional Canvas Scale Hardening | 0/0 | ⏸ **DEFERRED, never built** — ship condition never fired → carry-forward |

**What shipped that mattered most.** Per-node *graded governance* (185): a node is strict when
grounded — the immutable `citations_required` coverage gate auto-attaches at RUN time to any
KB-reading phase regardless of how it was authored — and flexible when open, freely mixed in one
workflow, with the strict gate not author-loosenable-away. The deep competitor crawl (Beam / Glean /
n8n) confirmed none of them grade strictness by KB-grounding. Governance became the shape of the
artifact rather than a bolted-on run-time check.

**What did not ship, stated plainly.** Operator HARD gate #3's live half is at ⅓. A real Slack
message left the application through the full governed path — approval gate, six ordered guards,
send, `external_action_sent` audit receipt (`6379787c`) — but `_adapter_args` supplies only each
capability's `body_arg`, so Jira's `summary` and SMTP's `to`/`subject` have no author-facing field
and neither can be driven from a workflow. Slack works because its one required field happens to be
that arg. Recorded `D-190-DEF-17`; deliberately not patched at close because the fix is a phase
(schema + form + serializer) whose shape question is exactly what SEED-144/145/146 re-opened.

**Debt carried out of the milestone:** three missing `VERIFICATION.md` files carrying nine
requirements (184, 188, 189 — all wired and UAT-backed; documentation debt, not engineering debt) ·
SEED-133 and SEED-134 accepted risks · four phases at `nyquist_compliant: false` (181-184) ·
`phase_types.py` and `threads.py` both G-5 firing · **cloud parity owed at migrations 104 → 118,
where 118 is SECURITY-BEARING** (until applied, cloud still carries the CR-01 credential exposure —
118 and the `connector_service.py` deploy must land in the same operation).

**Security:** zero debt at close — all nine threat-modelled phases at `threats_open: 0`.

## v3.5 UX Consolidation & Chat Polish — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-23 (CORE); STRETCH deferred

**Started:** 2026-07-22 (operator-confirmed UX-track sequencing at v3.4-close: the polish cluster now, Visual Workflow Studio next as v3.6). **Roadmap created:** 2026-07-22. **Shipped:** 2026-07-23 (git tag `v3.5`; CORE 174-177; STRETCH 178-180 deferred → `.planning/v3.5-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`). Full detail archived → `.planning/milestones/v3.5-ROADMAP.md`.

**Goal:** Clear the parked `surface: Agentic-RAG` chat-surface bug backlog and consolidate the accumulated UI/UX rough edges — including the brand-new v3.4 org surfaces — into one coherent, polished, honest experience, before the large v3.6 Visual Workflow Studio build. A **Medium cleanup milestone**: mostly bug-fix + polish, no large net-new build; deliberately kept **separate** from v3.6.

**Red line (every phase):** never fork the shared Deep/agent-loop/provider path — provider differences stay at the gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary (D-14). Deep Mode stays byte-identical; no new runtime.

**Numbering:** CORE **Phases 174-177**, STRETCH **Phases 178-180**. **Phases 169-173 are RESERVED** for the deferred v3.4 STRETCH carry-forwards (Dept-Admin, Entitlements, Permission-Aware Citations, OIDC SSO, Dept-Skills — `.planning/v3.4-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`) and are NOT reused here. Migrations: this is a cleanup milestone — prefer app-layer fixes; the head at v3.5's close was **113**, **next free slot = 114 reserved ONLY if a specific bug fix genuinely needs schema** (none expected). ⚠ *HISTORICAL — accurate when v3.5 shipped 2026-07-23. The live head is **115** as of 2026-08-07; see the v3.6 migrations bullet.*

**Scope source:** `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (14 CORE + 9 STRETCH = 23 reqs). **Reported-bugs mandate:** this milestone IS the home of the parked backlog — at every `/gsd:discuss-phase`, re-list open/deferred `surface: Agentic-RAG` reports and fold the matching ones explicitly (some "open" reports may already be fixed-pending-verification — triage fix-vs-verify).

### Phase Table (CORE — Phases 174-177)

| Phase | Name | Goal | Requirements | SC# | Flags |
|-------|------|------|--------------|-----|-------|
| 174 | Run-State & Lifecycle Honesty | Every run's lifecycle (setup → stream → stop/cancel/kill → navigation) is honestly reflected — no empty bubbles, no lost stop indicators, no hidden setup activity, no timer/avatar glitches | STATE-01, STATE-02, STATE-03, STATE-04 | 5 | **SC#10**; **G-2 sketch** (honest run-state "feels like"); **G-5** (`MessageItem.tsx`/`StreamsProvider.tsx`/`useMessages.ts`/`threads.py`); reported-bugs fold (5); UI hint; no threat model; no migration |
| 175 | Cross-Provider Streaming Fidelity | Newer reasoning models + non-OpenAI providers stream cleanly — correct params (no 400s), no tool-markup leak, honest title-gen fallback — all at the adapter/sanitizer boundary | XPROV-01, XPROV-02, XPROV-03 | 4 | **SC#10**; **G-5** (gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary); **red line D-14**; reported-bugs fold (4); OpenRouter-400s OUT; no threat model; no migration |

| 177 | v3.4 Org-Surface Polish | The new v3.4 org surfaces (admin shell, switcher, profile anchor, invitations, SSO sign-in) are polished + error-honest across every state — without widening the already-secured 166-168 authz | ORGUX-01, ORGUX-02 | 3 | **G-2 sketch** (org-surface "feels like"); **G-5 light** (`StreamsProvider.tsx` — keep `<OrgContext>` OUTSIDE the stream path, 067.5 Branch-D3 guard); rolls in 166/167/168 live-UAT status-lag; UI hint; **no SC#10**; **no threat model** (polish over secured surfaces, not new authz); no migration |

### Phase Table (STRETCH — gated behind CORE — Phases 178-180)

Committed as gated phases (ship only if CORE lands clean and budget remains; v2.9 105-109 / v3.1 125-131 / v3.2 138-144 / v3.3 156-159 / v3.4 169-173 precedent).

| Phase | Name | Goal | Requirements | SC# | Flags |
|-------|------|------|--------------|-----|-------|
| 178 | Chat UI/UX Polish Pass (SEED-045 umbrella) | Sweep the collected chat/nav polish seeds into one coherent pass — SEED-045 remainder, provider-logo/nav consistency, a legible cited-vs-retrieved citation footer, run-state-aware todos, workspace-panel reliability | POLISH-01, POLISH-02, POLISH-03, POLISH-04, POLISH-05 | 4 | — (SEED-045 anchors shipped in 156); **SC#10** (run-state todos + workspace panel + provider logos touch live state); **G-2 sketch**; **G-5** (`ToolCallPanel.tsx`/`MessageItem.tsx`/workspace panel/`useMessages.ts`/`providerLogo.tsx`); SEED-098 = verify/close only; UI hint |
| 179 | Plain-Language / Terminology Extensions | Extend the shipped v3.3 plain-language layer (`termMap`) onto the new org + chat surfaces so jargon doesn't creep back in | LANG-01 | 2 | — (extends Phase-154; best after 177 so org labels exist); label layer — **no SC#10, no G-2, no G-5**; red line (no enum/API/audit break, Deep byte-identical); UI hint |
| 180 | Agent-Loop Behavior Honesty | The agent honors explicit step-by-step / todo-loop requests, Anthropic's end-of-cycle output shows a user-facing summary (not a raw action list), and excessive tool iterations are bounded + honest | LOOP-01, LOOP-02, LOOP-03 | 4 | — (touches the agent loop — most careful STRETCH); **SC#10**; **G-5** (`agent_loop.py`/`anthropic_service.py` — both hot-file rows); **red line D-14**; reported-bugs fold (3 deferred majors + BUG-260626-02/-03); may warrant careful decomposition |

### Phase Details

#### Phase 174: Run-State & Lifecycle Honesty

**Goal**: Every run's lifecycle — setting up, streaming, stopping, cancelling, being killed, and navigating away-and-back — is honestly reflected in the chat surface, so a user is never left staring at an empty bubble, a lost stop indicator, a hidden model, or a glitched timer/avatar.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase — stabilizes the run-lifecycle surface the later chat phases render on).
**Requirements**: STATE-01, STATE-02, STATE-03, STATE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A cancelled or killed run leaves no empty chat bubble and no orphaned run card — the surface honestly shows "cancelled — no output yet" (STATE-01).
  2. The "Response stopped" / stop indicator survives navigating away-and-back AND a full page reload (STATE-02) — read from the authoritative `runs.status` (FND-01/145), no new persistence needed.
  3. During "Setting up agent…", the user sees live model activity instead of a state that hides the model working (STATE-03).
  4. Run timers stay accurate when navigating to a workflow run — no timer reset, no duplicate avatar (STATE-04).
  5. All four hold across providers, multi-tool prompts, parallel threads, and long histories with Deep Mode byte-identical (SC#10).

**Plans**: 4 plans (3 waves)

- [x] 174-01-PLAN.md — STATE-03 pre-answer reasoning honesty (`outerBannerLabel` reasoningActive → "Reasoning…") [Wave 1]
- [x] 174-02-PLAN.md — STATE-01a + STATE-02 verify-and-close (cancelled-no-output + stop-indicator reload-derive) [Wave 1]
- [x] 174-03-PLAN.md — STATE-01b killed-workflow amber block (403 catch branch + composer unlock) [Wave 2]
- [x] 174-04-PLAN.md — STATE-04 workflow-run timer anchor + single avatar (startedAt stamp + pre-runId dedup) [Wave 3]

**UI hint**: yes
**Flags**: SC#10; G-2 sketch (honest run-state "feels like"); G-5 (`MessageItem.tsx`, `StreamsProvider.tsx`, `useMessages.ts`, `threads.py` run-lifecycle — audit at discuss); reported-bugs fold (`cancelled-run-empty-bubble-early-cancel`, `killed-workflow-empty-chat-card`, `cancelled-run-stop-indicator-lost-on-navigation`, `setting-up-agent-hides-model-activity`, `BUG-260610-01`); no threat model; no migration.

#### Phase 175: Cross-Provider Streaming Fidelity

**Goal**: Newer reasoning models and non-OpenAI providers stream cleanly — correct request params (no 400s), no tool-call markup leaking into visible content, and honest title-generation fallback — all handled at the gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary with the shared path unforked.
**Depends on**: Phase 174 (lands after run-state honesty so the cross-provider streaming blast radius is clean).
**Requirements**: XPROV-01, XPROV-02, XPROV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Newer reasoning models (gpt-5.6 class) send correct request params — no model-parameter 400 on chat or with tools (XPROV-01).
  2. DeepSeek tool-call markup never leaks into visible chat content; the re-parse/strip guard holds on long turns (XPROV-02).
  3. Title-generation cross-provider fallback is honest — no misleading fallback banner when a provider actually succeeds (XPROV-03).
  4. All three hold across the native providers with Deep Mode byte-identical — provider handling stays at the adapter/sanitizer boundary, no shared-path fork (SC#10 / D-14).

**Plans**: 4 plans (2 waves) — XPROV-04 (BUG-260722-01) folded in per D-05.

- [x] 175-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: capability markers (reasoning_first + reasoning_off SAFE list) + shared provider-safe utility-model guard (XPROV-01/03/04 substrate) [Wave 1]
- [x] 175-02-PLAN.md — XPROV-02: DSML strip stream-end flush + honest-incomplete leak signal (Option-B post-drain, existing `error` event) [Wave 1]
- [x] 175-03-PLAN.md — XPROV-01: reasoning_first STRUCTURED gate in resolve_calling_mode + honest reasoning-tools-unsupported error copy [Wave 2]
- [x] 175-04-PLAN.md — XPROV-03/04: provider-safe guard at title-gen + suggestion + per-MODEL reasoning-off title call [Wave 2]

**Flags**: SC#10; G-5 (gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary — `openai_compat.py` DeepSeek strip, the `openai_service` param builder, `thread_title.py`; audit at discuss); red line D-14 (adapter boundary only); reported-bugs fold (`BUG-260714-01`, `BUG-260711-02` [deferred — triage fix-vs-verify], `BUG-260708-01`, `BUG-260623-01`, `BUG-260722-01` → XPROV-04); OpenRouter-specific 400s stay OUT (experimental — fix only if native-safe + low-complexity); no threat model; no migration.

#### Phase 176: Chat Render Correctness + Exec Reliability

**Goal**: The chat transcript renders each message exactly once, un-folded at a clean terminal, with honest send outcomes and live version-pointer updates — and the `execute_code` tool installs requested libraries reliably instead of silently no-op'ing.
**Depends on**: Phase 174 (shares the chat-render/streaming surface the run-state phase stabilizes).
**Requirements**: RENDER-01, RENDER-02, RENDER-03, RENDER-04, EXEC-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. No duplicate user bubble — the optimistic temp row and the persisted row reconcile to exactly one (RENDER-01).
  2. The final answer renders un-folded at a clean terminal — no reload required to lift it out of the narration fold (RENDER-02).
  3. A submitted general-chat message always sends or surfaces an honest failure — no intermittent silent send-drop (RENDER-03).
  4. An approved skill/description version pointer updates in the UI without a reload (RENDER-04).
  5. The `execute_code` `libraries` parameter installs the requested packages reliably — no silent no-op, no wasted retry rounds (EXEC-01).

**Plans**: 4 plans (2 waves) — created 2026-07-22

- [x] 176-01-PLAN.md — RENDER-01 + RENDER-02: StreamsProvider reconcile correctness (user-bubble content-supersede drop + mount-path onTerminal un-fold by run.run_id) [Wave 1]
- [x] 176-02-PLAN.md — RENDER-04: Skill-Studio live version pointer (refreshVersions mirror of refreshGate + VersionsTab refreshNonce) [Wave 1]
- [x] 176-03-PLAN.md — EXEC-01: reliable execute_code install (python -m pip same-interpreter, retry x1) + bounded ModuleNotFound auto-heal + honest tool result [Wave 1]
- [x] 176-04-PLAN.md — RENDER-03: honest send-drop (non-dispatch → failedSendDrafts/reconcileErrors seam) + fresh-thread pending-send ordering [Wave 2, depends 176-01]

**UI hint**: yes
**Flags**: SC#10 (chat UI state + agent loop); G-2 sketch (render visual — D-13: NO fresh sketch, sketch 014 + StreamingNarration are the anchor); G-5 (`StreamsProvider.tsx` render-layer only — additive reconcile at existing seams, no refactor-first; EXEC-01 → `tool_dispatcher.py` only, sandbox_service unchanged); reported-bugs fold (`BUG-260712-02`, `BUG-260707-03`, `general-chat-intermittent-silent-send-drop`, `BUG-260706-01`, `BUG-260708-02`; minor `BUG-260609-02`/`-04` deferred → Phase 178); honest threat model (no new trust boundary — all `accept`); no migration (D-16 — all app-layer).

#### Phase 177: v3.4 Org-Surface Polish

**Goal**: The brand-new v3.4 org surfaces — org-admin shell, org switcher, profile-menu identity anchor, invitations, and SSO sign-in — are polished and error-honest across every state (member vs org-admin, 1-org vs multi-org, success vs failure), while the polish keeps the already-secured 166–168 authz intact.
**Depends on**: Nothing hard (an independent org surface); sequenced after Phase 174 so the shared nav/profile shell is stable first.
**Requirements**: ORGUX-01, ORGUX-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The org-admin shell, org switcher, and profile-menu identity anchor read correctly and honestly across states — member vs org-admin, single-org vs multi-org (ORGUX-01).
  2. The invitations and SSO surfaces (invite dialog, invitations tab, `/invite` landing, SSO tab, identifier-first sign-in) are polished and surface honest errors instead of dead-ends (ORGUX-02).
  3. The polish preserves the already-secured 166–168 authz — no widening of org-admin capability, no cross-org leak, no new trust boundary.

**Plans**: 5 plans (2 waves) — created 2026-07-23

- [x] 177-01-PLAN.md — Wave 0: extract the 3 shared org-zone primitives — `StatusChip` (D-08) · `RoleBadge`/`OrgIdentity` (D-04) · `HonestNotice` (D-11) + co-located tests [Wave 1]
- [x] 177-02-PLAN.md — Identity cohesion: OrgBand + ProfileMenu → shared RoleBadge; per-org-role / honest-absent / indigo-vs-amber-zone audit-and-lock (ORGUX-01, D-04/05/06/07) [Wave 2]
- [x] 177-03-PLAN.md — Management chips: InvitationsTab + SsoTab → shared StatusChip, RETIRE the UPPERCASE off-grid fork + snap to the 4px grid; link-first + victim-naming preserved (ORGUX-02, D-08/09/10) [Wave 2]
- [x] 177-04-PLAN.md — Roster + invite dialog: OrgMembersTab + InviteMemberDialog → shared RoleBadge/StatusChip/OrgAvatar + 4px grid; roster stays a pure read leaf (ORGUX-01/02, D-04/08/09/10) [Wave 2]
- [x] 177-05-PLAN.md — Entry/failure honesty: one AuthCardShell + HonestNotice across SignInForm + AcceptInvitePage; recoverable dead-ends → calm; legible fail-open note (ORGUX-02, D-11/12/13/14) [Wave 2]

**UI hint**: yes
**Flags**: G-2 sketch (org-surface polish — "feels like"); G-5 light (`StreamsProvider.tsx` — keep `<OrgContext>` OUTSIDE the stream path, preserve the 067.5 Branch-D3 clear guard); rolls in the 166/167/168 live-UAT status-lag (cross-provider SC#10 + SSO round-trip); no SC#10 (not streamed state); no threat model (polish over already-secured surfaces, not new authz); no migration. Fold the LANG-01 relabel here if Phase 179 hasn't run yet.

#### Phase 178: Chat UI/UX Polish Pass (SEED-045 umbrella) — STRETCH

**Goal**: Sweep the collected chat/nav polish seeds into one coherent pass — the SEED-045 remainder, provider-logo/nav-presence consistency, a legibly-superset citation footer, run-state-aware todos, and workspace-panel reliability — so the accumulated minor rough edges land as one polished surface rather than scattered inserts.
**Depends on**: — (gated behind CORE completion; the SEED-045 rail/chat-list anchors already shipped in Phase 156, so this is the remainder).
**Requirements**: POLISH-01, POLISH-02, POLISH-03, POLISH-04, POLISH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The SEED-045 remainder minor-enhancement items land as one coherent polish pass (POLISH-01).
  2. Provider logos / nav-presence are consistent across the chat surface (POLISH-02 / SEED-058).
  3. The citation footer legibly reads as a superset of the inline `[n]` markers — cited-vs-retrieved is clear (POLISH-03 / SEED-119).
  4. The todos panel reflects the live run's state honestly (POLISH-04 / SEED-105) and the workspace panel is reliable + polished across run states (POLISH-05 / SEED-039).

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
**Flags**: SC#10 (run-state-aware todos + workspace panel + provider logos touch live-run / provider state); G-2 sketch (visual polish); G-5 (`ToolCallPanel.tsx`, `MessageItem.tsx`, the workspace panel, `useMessages.ts`, `providerLogo.tsx` — audit at discuss). **SEED-098 (tool-card dedup) = verify/close only** — already largely shipped via quick-task 260630-226; NOT a fresh build. No threat model; no migration.

#### Phase 179: Plain-Language / Terminology Extensions — STRETCH

**Goal**: Extend the shipped v3.3 plain-language layer (LANG-01 / `termMap`) onto the new v3.4 org surfaces and chat surfaces so jargon doesn't creep back in — purely a label layer behind the existing advanced reveal.
**Depends on**: — (gated behind CORE completion; extends the shipped Phase-154 plain-language reveal; best sequenced after Phase 177 so the org-surface labels exist to relabel).
**Requirements**: LANG-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The v3.3 plain-language reveal covers the new org + chat surfaces — jargon terms map to plain language behind the existing advanced reveal (LANG-01 / SEED-085).
  2. The relabel is additive — no enum/API/audit break, Deep Mode byte-identical (Phase-154 Pitfall-15 precedent).

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
**Flags**: no SC#10 (label layer); no G-2 (label pass, not net-new visual — Phase-154 precedent); no G-5 (additive term map); red line (no shared-path / enum break); no threat model; no migration.

#### Phase 180: Agent-Loop Behavior Honesty — STRETCH

**Goal**: The agent honors an explicit step-by-step / todo-loop request instead of collapsing it into one turn, Anthropic's end-of-cycle output shows a user-facing summary (not a raw action list), and excessive tool iterations on multi-step tasks are bounded and honest — all at the agent-loop / adapter boundary with Deep Mode byte-identical.
**Depends on**: — (gated behind CORE completion; touches the agent loop, so it is the most careful STRETCH — sequence after CORE lands clean).
**Requirements**: LOOP-01, LOOP-02, LOOP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The agent honors an explicit step-by-step / todo-loop request instead of collapsing it into one turn (LOOP-01).
  2. Anthropic's end-of-cycle output shows a user-facing summary, not a raw action list (LOOP-02).
  3. Excessive tool iterations on multi-step tasks are reduced — bounded and honest — without regressing legitimate multi-step work (LOOP-03).
  4. All three hold across providers with Deep Mode byte-identical — provider-specific behavior stays at the adapter boundary, no shared-path fork (SC#10 / D-14).

**Plans**: TBD
**Flags**: SC#10; G-5 (`agent_loop.py` + `anthropic_service.py` — both on the hot-file ledger; audit at discuss); red line D-14; reported-bugs fold (`agent-ignores-step-by-step-request-no-todo-loop`, `anthropic-end-of-cycle-shows-actions-not-summary`, `anthropic-excessive-tool-iterations-on-multi-step-tasks`; related deferred `BUG-260626-02` baseline-leak-into-final-emit, `BUG-260626-03` run-end todo finalizer); may warrant its own careful decomposition at discuss-phase.

**Guardrails firing (v3.5):**

- **G-2 sketch-first** on Phase 174 (honest run-state "feels like"), Phase 176 (render visual work), Phase 177 (org-surface polish), Phase 178 (chat polish seeds) — all live-UI / "feels like" surfaces. `/gsd:sketch` before `/gsd:spec-phase` / `/gsd:discuss-phase`. Phase 179 (label layer) needs no sketch (Phase-154 precedent).
- **G-5 hot files (audit at discuss-phase):** `MessageItem.tsx` / `StreamsProvider.tsx` / `useMessages.ts` (174, 176, 178), `ToolCallPanel.tsx` + workspace panel (178), `threads.py` (174 run-lifecycle — producer extraction paid down in 162.5 but the file stays hot), `agent_loop.py` + `anthropic_service.py` (180 — both hot-file ledger rows), the gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary (175).
- **SC#10 (cross-provider mandate):** 174, 175, 176 (CORE chat surface) + 178 (run-state todos / workspace panel / provider logos touch live state) + 180 (agent loop). ORGUX (177) + LANG (179) deliberately NOT flagged — neither touches streamed state.
- **Reported-bugs mandate:** this milestone IS the parked chat-surface backlog's home — cross-check `.planning/reported-bugs/` (`surface: Agentic-RAG`, status open/deferred) at each `/gsd:discuss-phase` and fold matching reports; some "open" reports may be already-fixed-pending-verification (triage fix-vs-verify).
- **Threat models:** NONE this milestone — UI/bug-fix cleanup; ORGUX (177) is polish over the already-secured 166–168 surfaces, not new authz. Flag one only if a discuss-phase surfaces a real trust boundary.
- **Red line (D-14):** never fork the shared path — provider differences stay at the gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary. Deep Mode byte-identical; no new runtime.
- **Cloud parity owed:** migrations 099–113 + `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` still owed at the next production push (no new v3.5 migrations expected).

## v3.4 Multi-Tenancy & Org Access — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-22 (CORE); STRETCH deferred

Full detail archived → **`.planning/milestones/v3.4-ROADMAP.md`** · requirements → **`.planning/milestones/v3.4-REQUIREMENTS.md`** · summary → **`.planning/MILESTONES.md`** · STRETCH carry-forward guide → **`.planning/v3.4-STRETCH-CARRYFORWARD.md`**.

CORE Phases 160-168 (10 phases incl. the 162.5 `threads.py` refactor; 56 plans, 121 tasks) — the load-bearing **one-way RLS door** that turns Agentic RAG from a per-user app into an org-aware multi-tenant platform. **Tenancy foundation (160-162):** a ratify-not-relitigate Tenancy ADR (D-v3.4-01), the 8-table org/dept/role schema with correct-from-birth membership RLS + `current_user_org_ids()` (mig 104), and personal-org backfill across 35 tables (migs 105/106). **The atomic crux (162.5-164):** the `threads.py` producer extraction (2444→1214 LOC, `agent_loop` byte-identical) then the RLS rewrite + per-request user-JWT client swap (migs 107/108, FIX-A 109) so membership RLS is ENFORCED on every request path, then the SECDEF audit + `document_chunks`/`skill_embeddings` org-scoping + the two-org isolation exit-gate suite (mig 110). **Cleanup + surfaces (165-168):** `is_global` semantic retirement (mig 111 → `is_org_shared` / `is_system_global`), the org-admin shell/switcher/profile/audit + Settings split, invitations/roles/greenlists/JIT/per-user-prefs, and SAML SSO self-service (mig 113 — Supabase is the SAML SP, 0 new hard deps). 22/22 CORE requirements delivered + threat-secured (`threats_open: 0` across the isolation cluster + 166/167/168; SEED-124 + SEED-125 cross-org leaks closed). **Owed on cloud:** migrations 104-113 + `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Live UAT (cross-provider SC#10 + the SSO round-trip, which needs cloud + a real IdP) rolls forward. **STRETCH 169-173** (Dept-Admin shell, entitlement/retention footholds, permission-aware citations, OIDC SSO, dept-targeted skills) deferred with concrete re-open triggers → the carry-forward guide.

## v3.3 Operator UX — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-18

Full detail archived → **`.planning/milestones/v3.3-ROADMAP.md`** · requirements → **`.planning/milestones/v3.3-REQUIREMENTS.md`** · summary → **`.planning/MILESTONES.md`**.

14 phases (146–159), 95 plans, 212 tasks. Made the platform operable + configurable by a non-developer operator from the UI. **Operator tier (146–148):** a gated `/admin` Control Room behind a byte-identical-404 `require_operator` gate (no RLS backstop — app-layer isolation) + operator audit ledger — health, active-runs + Kill, fail-closed capability kill-switches, maintenance/read-only mode, audit browser, user roster, API-enforced feature visibility. **Model & secrets (149–150, 159):** a dynamic model-capability registry + live propose-only discovery (no restart, no silently-guessed capabilities), add-model-by-ID + utility-filtered discovery curation (159), and app-layer Fernet secrets-at-rest with env-fallback. **Files & workflows (151–152):** `fetch_document_file` + `attach_skill_file` agent tools, Run-modal file-input + per-run KB-folder scope + safe workflow delete. **Trust & friendliness UX (153–156):** per-claim inline citations keyed to the run's real retrieval set, an app-wide plain-language layer behind an advanced reveal, a WCAG-AA sweep, everyday nav/thread polish. **Deployment (157–158):** Solo/Team/Enterprise presets + `docker-compose.prod.yml` + `OPERATOR.md`, and an idempotent lock-after-finalize install wizard at `/setup`. 20/20 requirements (16 CORE + 4 STRETCH); WFIN-02 one operator-accepted OpenRouter-axis limitation (external BUG-260714-02). Migrations 095–103; `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env. Threat-secured across 146–150 / 153 / 154 / 158 / 159 (`threats_open: 0`).

16 phases (132, 133, 134, 134.1, 135, 136, 137, 137.1, 137.2, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145), 81 plans. Turned the v3.1 Skill Trigger Tuner into a full **Skill Eval Studio**: persistent eval test cases + immutable skill versions, a with-skill-vs-without eval runner with a dual-arm LLM judge + honest per-provider verdicts + human ratings, a human-in-the-loop self-improvement loop, a publish gate, and the Evals·Triggering·Versions panel — plus a built-in skill-creator (every user, read-only + protected), STRETCH honesty phases (run-end honesty, smart-dispatch skill pre-filter, run-scoped template resolver, non-Python skill-script honesty), the FND-01 run-lifecycle foundation (`runs.status` authoritative + `threads.py` G-5 extraction, live SC#10 UAT 6/6), and a curated **Starter Workflow Library** (WF-01 — 3 KB→document starters proven live end-to-end: fork → judge-approved publish gauntlet → cited `.docx`).

**Deferred → v3.3:** FILE-01 (Phase 144, Agent-Driven Skill File Attachment — gated STRETCH, not executed; rolls forward with the workflow-file cluster SEED-110/112). **Verification debt:** live UATs pending/partial on 140/141/142/143 (see MILESTONES.md → Known Gaps).

**Next:** v3.3 Operator UX (authoritative map: `PRDs/SEQUENCE.md`).

## v3.1 Workflow & Skill Studio — Trust, Clarity & Triggers — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-28

**Started:** 2026-06-21 (Option A — scope LOCKED + operator-approved). Numbering continues from v3.0's last phase (119) → **CORE Phases 120-124**, then **STRETCH Phases 125-131** (gated behind CORE — ship only if CORE lands clean and budget remains; v2.9 105-109 precedent). *Phase 131 (SRH-01, non-Python skill-script honesty) folded in 2026-06-22 after a JS-skill-import investigation — SEED-044 Layer 1; the full Node-execution capability stays v3.2 DISC-01.*

**Goal:** Make the agent's skills + workflows trustworthy, legible, and reliably triggered across *all* providers — fix the live workflow↔skill collision (a confirmed, root-caused bug), lift cross-provider honesty to OpenAI-parity, add a Skill Trigger Tuner, and re-skin the Workflow Studio so each workflow's "soul" is obvious with a strict↔loose authoring/running split.

**Red line (every phase):** never fork the shared Deep/agent-loop/provider path — provider differences stay at the gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary (D-14). Deep Mode stays byte-identical; no new runtime.

**Scope source:** `.planning/research/v3.1-skills-eval/CONSOLIDATED-SCOPE.md` (LOCKED). Operator pressures: `.planning/research/v3.1-skills-eval/OPERATOR-INPUTS.md`.

### Phase Table (CORE)

| Phase | Name | Goal | Requirements | SC# | Flags |
|-------|------|------|--------------|-----|-------|
| 120 | Collision Fix + Context Isolation | A skill saving one file in a workflow-touched thread emits exactly that file, and Deep/Harness stop replaying each other's history | COLL-01, CTX-01 | 4 | G-5 (`threads.py` firing → extraction due, `agent_loop.py` `_reconstruct_history`); SC#10 |
| 121 | One Front Door for Workflows (IA) | Workflows launch from a single front door; the chat composer drops to 2-pill General/Explorer while the lock/409/reconcile is preserved | IA-01 | 3 | G-2 sketch-gated; UI hint; SC#10 |

| 123 | Skill Triggering Quality | A skill author can tune a description against a held-out benchmark, weak descriptions are flagged at save, and loaded skills don't fall out of context mid-session | TRIG-01, TRIG-03, CTX-03 | 5 | G-5 (`context_window.py`/`agent_loop.py` trim path for CTX-03); SC#10 (TRIG-01 cross-provider) |
| 123.1 (INSERTED) | Skill Trigger Tuner — Design Fidelity & UX Polish | The Trigger Tuner result surface reads cleanly at the org's real provider count, the seeded benchmark is visible/editable before running, a completed result survives refresh, and the builder model is choosable from configured models | TRIG-01 (gap-closure, BUG-260624-01) | TBD | G-2 sketch-gated (sketches 041–044 exist); frontend-heavy; SC#10 (cross-provider legibility) |
| 124 | Workflow Studio UX — Soul + Strict↔Loose | A user sees a workflow's "soul" at a glance in 3 sizes and meets a clear strict↔loose split ("Describe & run" vs "Author & govern") | WUX-01, WUX-02 | 4 | G-2 sketch-gated (both); UI hint; G-5 (`PhaseTimeline.tsx`/`PhaseCard.tsx`) |

### Phase Table (STRETCH — gated behind CORE)

| Phase | Name | Goal | Requirements | SC# | Flags |
|-------|------|------|--------------|-----|-------|
| 125 | Self-Improve Proposer (description-only) | A bounded, human-in-the-loop description-only proposer drafts a description diff → human approves → new immutable version; never auto-publishes | SI-02 (STRETCH) | 3 | SC#10 (judge-as-gate cross-provider); depends on 122 + 123 |
| 126 | Smart-Dispatch Relevance Pre-Filter | Only plausibly-relevant skills are surfaced to the model and the catalog stays within a token budget | TRIG-02 (STRETCH) | 3 | G-5 (catalog injection path); SC#10; depends on 123 |
| 127 | Gauntlet Pip-Strip + Quiet Idle Cards | The publish gauntlet renders as a pip-strip + worded verdict with raw-on-demand; idle PhaseCards stay quiet | WUX-03 (STRETCH) | 2 | G-2 sketch-gated; UI hint; G-5 (`PhaseCard.tsx`); depends on 124 |
| 128 | Chat Tool-Card Unification + Chat-Area Reclaim | One honest, unified, space-efficient chat surface across every provider: live description before `tool_start` + provider logos in the tool-card header + a tool card that uniformly carries all run info + removing the redundant sticky composer timer + Read-more on long prompts | TDP-02, CTC-01, CTC-02, CTC-03, CTC-04 (STRETCH) | 5 | **G-2 sketch-gated** (now visual); SC#10 (cross-provider tool-card parity); **G-5** (`ToolCallPanel.tsx`/`MessageItem.tsx`/`ChatArea.tsx` — audit refactor-vs-feature at discuss); depends on 122 |
| 129 | MiniMax/OpenRouter Arg Repair | MiniMax malformed-args boundary repair + OpenRouter `require_parameters` for broader provider robustness | MP-04 (STRETCH) | 2 | G-5 (gateway/adapter boundary); SC#10; depends on 122 |
| 130 | template_input Resolver Run-Scope | The `template_input` resolver is run-scoped too — defense-in-depth for the `render_template` path alongside COLL-01 | COLL-02 (STRETCH) | 2 | depends on 120 |
| 131 | Non-Python Skill-Script Honesty | A user importing/running a skill with a non-Python script (e.g. `.js`) gets an honest message instead of a silent failure; instructions still work | SRH-01 (STRETCH) | 3 | additive, OFF the COLL-01 seam; SEED-044 Layer 1; precursor to v3.2 DISC-01 |

### Phase Details

#### Phase 120: Collision Fix + Context Isolation

**Goal**: A skill that runs in a thread that previously ran a workflow emits only its own output, and a subsequent Deep turn never replays the workflow's history — the live, root-caused collision (Mechanism A) is closed at the harvest baseline and the history-reconstruction filter.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase; sequenced EARLY because COLL-01 is a confirmed live bug)
**Requirements**: COLL-01, CTX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A skill `execute_code` that saves exactly one file in a thread that previously ran a workflow emits exactly that one file — the prior workflow's leftover `/sandbox/output/` artifact is never re-emitted (the confirmed 2-files bug is gone).
  2. The sandbox-output harvest is run-scoped to its own run's baseline, so any file present before the run starts is excluded from that run's emitted outputs.
  3. When Deep chat and a workflow share a thread, a Deep turn's history reconstruction replays only `messages.origin = deep` rows, and a workflow phase replays only its `harness` rows — workflow context never bleeds into a subsequent Deep turn.
  4. The collision fix holds across providers, multi-tool prompts, parallel threads, and long (≥50-message) histories — Deep Mode stays byte-identical on the native-7 (no shared-path fork; SC#10).

**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 120-01-PLAN.md — COLL-01: run-scope the sandbox-output harvest (snapshot+hash baseline seed) + headline live-repro regression test
- [x] 120-02-PLAN.md — CTX-01: author migration 076 (messages.origin) + tag every harness insert site + asymmetric origin filter at agent_loop.py:1024
- [x] 120-03-PLAN.md — [BLOCKING] apply migration 076 to live DB (SQL-editor paste) + regenerate full-schema.sql + live-DB integration test

#### Phase 121: One Front Door for Workflows (IA)

**Goal**: A user launches workflows from a single, obvious front door (the Workflows page); the chat composer is simplified to a 2-pill General/Explorer control with the Harness pill and in-chat workflow selector removed, while the existing Harness↔Deep lock / 409 / reconcile behavior is preserved exactly.
**Depends on**: Phase 120 (context isolation is the actual collision fix; IA-01 is the clarity win that rides on top — and they touch overlapping thread/composer surfaces)
**Requirements**: IA-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The chat composer shows exactly two mode pills (General / Explorer) — the Harness pill and the in-chat workflow selector are gone, and the only place to launch a workflow is the Workflows page.
  2. Launching a workflow still works as an explicit "launch-in-context" action (the capability is not removed), and a launched workflow's thread still toggles into Harness mode and Continues correctly.
  3. The server-side Harness↔Deep lock still returns a 409 on an illegal switch, and the lock/reconcile behavior is unchanged from before the composer change.
  4. Behavior holds across providers and parallel threads with no Deep-mode regression (SC#10).

**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 121-01-PLAN.md — remove the Deep/Harness toggle + in-chat workflow picker (2-pill composer); preserve lock/409/reconcile + composer-stop Cancel (SC#1/SC#3)
- [x] 121-02-PLAN.md — rewrite ChatAreaMode + extend ChatAreaBanner + new ChatLayout launch test (SC#1/SC#2/SC#3 oracles)

**UI hint**: yes

#### Phase 122: Cross-Provider Trust & Honesty Parity

**Goal**: Structured emission is recovered-or-honest on every provider, each provider uses the emission path it actually supports (doc-verified, not guessed), cross-provider reliability is measured on a per-provider scoreboard that gates any tier change, and task/step labels are concrete on every provider (OpenAI-parity) — all at the gateway/adapter boundary, never the shared path.
**Depends on**: Phase 120 (lands after the collision fix so the cross-provider blast radius is clean)
**Requirements**: MP-01, MP-02, MP-03, TDP-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A model that silently fails a forced structured emit (e.g. the default model's no-metadata 400) is recovered by a force→coerce retry ladder in `forced_emit`, so a typed-artifact phase produces its emission instead of a silent empty result.
  2. Each provider's forcing/strict behavior is honest and doc-verified — an explicit `emit_tier` field replaces guesswork, the inert DeepSeek function-level `strict` is dropped, and GLM forcing is kept (intentional, live-verified).
  3. The eval treats provider as a first-class axis with a per-provider scoreboard (trigger / force / recovery / honest-fail), pass-OR-documented, and any `emit_tier` change is gated on that scoreboard (no silent tier flip).
  4. Task/todo/workflow-step labels are concrete on every provider (OpenAI-parity), not the bare tool name — an ungated prompt nudge fills `execute_code.description` and a deterministic frontend summarizer floor backstops providers that don't, without regressing providers that already do.
  5. The 4-axis SC#10 scoreboard (cross-provider × multi-tool × parallel-thread × long-message) passes as an EVAL axis (per MP-03), and Deep Mode stays byte-identical (no shared-path fork).

**Plans**: 4 plans

- [x] 122-01-PLAN.md — MP-02: explicit emit_tier field + 55-row registry migration (14/2/34/5) + remove the provider=="openai" gate + inert DeepSeek strict
- [x] 122-02-PLAN.md — MP-01: the ordered force_strict→non-strict→coerce→fail rung ladder inside forced_emit (reads emit_tier) + emit_rung telemetry
- [x] 122-03-PLAN.md — MP-03: --forced-emit scoreboard matrix (EASY+HARD × native-7, 4 axes PASS/FAIL/DOCUMENTED) + dated artifact + README grep ritual
- [x] 122-04-PLAN.md — TDP-01: ungated execute_code.description SYSTEM_PROMPT nudge + verified frontend label floor

#### Phase 123: Skill Triggering Quality

**Goal**: A skill author can measurably tune a skill's trigger description, the system flags weak trigger descriptions before a skill is saved, and a loaded skill's instructions stay available for the rest of the session instead of silently falling out of context.
**Depends on**: Phase 122 (the Trigger Tuner measures cross-provider on production model-ids; it reuses the per-provider scoreboard substrate landed in 122)
**Requirements**: TRIG-01, TRIG-03, CTX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A skill author can run a description against a held-out should-trigger / should-not-trigger benchmark (Skill Trigger Tuner) and pick the winning description by held-out score, measured cross-provider on production model-ids.
  2. The Trigger Tuner reports a concrete trigger/should-not score per candidate description so the author can see one description beat another, not just a pass/fail.
  3. At `save_skill` (and in the skill-creator loop) a description-quality lint flags a weak or ambiguous trigger description before the skill is saved.
  4. A skill loaded mid-conversation stays in context for the rest of the session — its instructions are pinned out of the rolling trim window and don't silently disappear after the window rolls.
  5. Trigger measurement and the pinned-instruction behavior hold across providers and long histories (SC#10) with no shared-path fork on the trim path.

**Plans**: 6 plans

- [x] 123-01-PLAN.md — TRIG-03 deterministic save-time lint (3 hook points, warn-never-block) + D-01 catalog-note relaxation (shared LOAD_SKILL_POLICY)
- [x] 123-02-PLAN.md — CTX-03 trim-pin: load_skill tool-result as a third protected class in trim_messages_to_fit (de-dupe, 1/3 budget, LRU evict + marker) + reconstruct tag (G-5 RED LINE)
- [x] 123-03-PLAN.md — TRIG-01 core: D-08 builder-model knob + skill_tuner_service (candidates, policy-faithful classification, 60/40 held-out scoring, N-column adaptivity, owner-scoped auto-seed)
- [x] 123-04-PLAN.md — TRIG-01 routes: owner-scoped skill_tuner router (bounded background job over the run-buffer + tuner-specific SSE + held-out scoreboard)
- [x] 123-05-PLAN.md — TRIG-01 UI: focused full-surface Trigger Tuner (reachability triad) — case editor, N-column scoreboard (fires/no-false), candidate cards, live-run card, author-confirm diff (041-A/042-A/043-A)
- [x] 123-06-PLAN.md — TRIG-03 UI loop: inline never-block lint warning + "Tune this" handoff + the D-08 builder-model Settings picker (044-A)

### Phase 123.1: Skill Trigger Tuner — design fidelity and UX polish (INSERTED)

**Goal:** The Skill Trigger Tuner reads cleanly at the org's real provider count, makes the benchmark visible/editable before a run, makes a completed result durable across refresh/restart, and lets the builder model be chosen from configured models — closing the live-UAT design-fidelity + UX gaps in BUG-260624-01 (HIGH + MED) without changing the scoring core, the agent loop, the shared chat path, or the CTX-03 trim-pin.
**Requirements**: TBD (scope contract = the 12 locked decisions D-01..D-12 in 123.1-CONTEXT.md + the live-UAT audit backlog TT-05/07/08/09/10/11/12/14/15/16 in 123.1-AUDIT-BACKLOG.md; each is covered by >=1 plan)
**Depends on:** Phase 123
**Plans:** 10/10 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 123.1-01-PLAN.md — Backend seam: tuner_runs table (migration 077) + durable latest-result upsert + GET-latest + seeded-cases GET + frontend wire (D-01/D-05/D-07/D-08)
- [x] 123.1-02-PLAN.md — Scoreboard polish: ProviderScoreboard vertical rows + magnitude bar + combined score; CandidateCard line-clamp/expand (D-02/D-04/D-11/D-12)
- [x] 123.1-03-PLAN.md — Settings builder-model picker from configured models + soft hint; remove IN-02 placeholders (D-09/D-10)
- [x] 123.1-04-PLAN.md — Page integration: full-width results, seeded-case hydrate/edit, standalone live-description scoreboard, result rehydration, pre-run cost preview + attribution (D-03/D-05/D-06/D-07/D-12)
- [x] 123.1-05-PLAN.md — [Wave 1] Editor-wall fix (sketch 045-B): backend seed-cap (MAX_SEEDED_SHOULD_NOT) + seeded GET `total` + legible/bounded CaseEditor + full-width pre-run stack (BUG-260624-01; seed-cap now load-bearing for RUN TIME per backlog section 5)
- [x] 123.1-06-PLAN.md — [Wave 2] Backend honesty: empty axis -> n/a not 1.0 (TT-05); all-error column -> unmeasured, excluded from target_count (TT-12); single-source cell_score (TT-15)
- [x] 123.1-07-PLAN.md — [Wave 3] Run UX: emit stage=provider_start so lanes flip queued->running (TT-07); real owner-scoped + run<->skill-bound DELETE cancel route + job checkpoint + claim release (TT-08)
- [x] 123.1-08-PLAN.md — [Wave 4] Run resilience: honest seeded-fetch note (TT-09); unmeasured-cell render (TT-12 render half); reconciling sub-state no-flash (TT-14); durable-poll reconnect honesty (TT-16)
- [x] 123.1-09-PLAN.md — [Wave 5] Layout: delete both decorative bg-sidebar deco-rails on SkillsPage + SkillTunerPage (TT-11)
- [x] 123.1-10-PLAN.md — [Wave 1] Observability: silence the LangSmith 429 uploader flood to ERROR + document LANGSMITH_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE (TT-10)

#### Phase 124: Workflow Studio UX — Soul + Strict↔Loose

**Goal**: A user immediately sees the "soul" of a workflow (its purpose, what it needs, its phase spine, its tier, its output) in three consistent sizes, and meets a clear strict↔loose disclosure that offers two doors ("Describe & run" vs "Author & govern") without removing any control — accuracy and governance preserved, complexity demoted one click.
**Depends on**: Phase 121 (the Workflows page is now the single front door; the soul re-skin builds on that consolidated surface)
**Requirements**: WUX-01, WUX-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A user sees a workflow's "soul" at a glance in three sizes (library card / run header / publish summary): its purpose (`business_requirement`), what it needs, a glyph-dot phase spine (no type ribbons/index noise), one tier chip, and its output line.
  2. The library card / run header / publish summary all show the same soul object consistently — a user recognizes a workflow by the same essence in all three places.
  3. Authoring and running expose a strict↔loose disclosure keyed off `deriveTier` — two clear doors ("Describe & run" vs "Author & govern") — where nothing is removed and advanced controls are demoted exactly one click.
  4. The strict↔loose split preserves accuracy and control — a power user can still reach every advanced control, and a loose user can describe-and-run without meeting governance complexity (sketch-approved mockup is the acceptance bar).

**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 124-01-PLAN.md — Wave 0 foundation: extract shared soulData (tierForDefinition + PHASE_GLYPHS + needs/deliverable) + net-new WorkflowSoul (3 sizes) + glyph-dot PhaseSpine (WUX-01)
- [x] 124-02-PLAN.md — card-scale soul on library cards + the two-door fork (Describe & run / Author & govern) at the Studio authoring entry; library-card Run preserved (WUX-01, WUX-02)
- [x] 124-03-PLAN.md — run-surface soul as a G-5 additive sibling in WorkspacePanel + publish-summary soul block prepend (D-06 ladder untouched) (WUX-01)

**UI hint**: yes

#### Phase 125: Self-Improve Proposer (description-only)

**Goal**: A bounded, human-in-the-loop, description-only self-improvement proposer: eval surfaces a weak description → proposes a description diff → DRAFT → human approves → a new immutable version; it never auto-publishes, uses held-out selection, and uses the Phase-102 judge as a gate.
**Depends on**: Phase 122 + Phase 123 (reuses the cross-provider scoreboard, the Trigger Tuner's held-out selection, and the judge gate); gated behind CORE completion
**Requirements**: SI-02 (STRETCH)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The proposer can take an eval signal on a weak description and produce a proposed description diff as a DRAFT — it never edits a live skill description and never auto-publishes.
  2. A human reviews the proposed diff and, on approval, the proposal becomes a new immutable version; on rejection nothing changes.
  3. A proposed description is selected by held-out score and must clear the Phase-102 judge gate before it can be presented as a recommendation.

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

#### Phase 126: Smart-Dispatch Relevance Pre-Filter

**Goal**: Only plausibly-relevant skills are surfaced to the model and the skill catalog stays within a token budget, so the model isn't flooded with irrelevant skills and the catalog doesn't blow the context budget.
**Depends on**: Phase 123 (builds on the skill-triggering work); gated behind CORE completion
**Requirements**: TRIG-02 (STRETCH)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. For a given user turn, only skills that pass a relevance pre-filter are surfaced to the model — clearly-irrelevant skills are not injected.
  2. The injected skill catalog stays within a defined token budget even as the user's skill count grows.
  3. The pre-filter never starves a genuinely-relevant skill (a should-trigger skill still reaches the model), verified cross-provider (SC#10).

**Plans**: TBD

#### Phase 127: Gauntlet Pip-Strip + Quiet Idle Cards

**Goal**: The publish gauntlet reads at a glance as a pip-strip + worded verdict with raw detail on demand, and idle PhaseCards stay visually quiet instead of competing for attention.
**Depends on**: Phase 124 (rides on the Workflow Studio UX re-skin); gated behind CORE completion
**Requirements**: WUX-03 (STRETCH)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The publish gauntlet renders as a pip-strip + a worded verdict, with the raw gauntlet detail available on demand (not shown by default).
  2. An idle PhaseCard stays quiet (no noisy animation/placeholder) and only animates when its phase is actually active (sketch-approved mockup is the acceptance bar).

**Plans**: 3 plans (planned 2026-06-27)

- [x] 127-01-PLAN.md — Icon foundation: build-time 3D-icon mechanism (unplugin-icons) + shared PHASE_GLYPHS 3D swap + PhaseSpine test migration
- [x] 127-02-PLAN.md — Publish gauntlet re-skin: energy-spine + worded verdict + raw-on-demand + golden-run hero (honesty contracts intact)
- [x] 127-03-PLAN.md — Living step-flow re-skin: quiet idle / bloomed active (activity line + engine chip) / folded done (G-5 PhaseCard/PhaseTimeline)

**UI hint**: yes

#### Phase 128: Chat Tool-Card Unification + Chat-Area Reclaim

**Goal**: One honest, unified, space-efficient chat surface across every provider — the tool card becomes the single canonical place for live run info, it reads identically on all providers, redundant chrome is removed, and every pixel of the chat area earns its place.
**Depends on**: Phase 122 (extends the task-label parity / tool-card honesty work); gated behind CORE completion
**Requirements**: TDP-02, CTC-01, CTC-02, CTC-03, CTC-04 (STRETCH)
**Reframed** 2026-06-27 (operator): the original narrow "Live Description Before tool_start" (TDP-02) was bundled with four operator-raised chat-surface improvements (CTC-01..04) because they share the same surface + G-5 hot files (`ToolCallPanel.tsx` / `MessageItem.tsx` / `ChatArea.tsx`) and one coherent vision — better as one sketched pass than five scattered inserts.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A tool's `description` appears in the preparing window before the `tool_start` event fires (TDP-02), so the user sees what the agent is about to do during the prep gap — across providers, no Deep-mode regression, no shared-path fork (SC#10).
  2. The tool-card header shows the actual provider's logo per-provider, replacing the generic brand-pulse "spot" avatar (CTC-01).
  3. The tool card carries a unified content/layout across ALL providers — the single canonical, complete surface for live run info (status, elapsed, step/file counts, description), with no per-provider gaps (CTC-02; provider-docs-first / SC#10 — verified uniform before relying on it).
  4. The redundant sticky elapsed timer above the composer (`ChatArea.tsx` 076.1 D-03; today inconsistent across providers) is removed once CTC-02 holds, reclaiming chat-area space (CTC-03).
  5. Long user prompts collapse to a clamped preview with a "Read more" expander instead of rendering full-height (CTC-04).
  6. The unified surface is sketch-approved (G-2) before planning — the operator-approved mockup is the acceptance bar.

**Plans**: 6 plans

- [x] 128-01-PLAN.md — Install @lobehub/icons (supply-chain checkpoint) [D-08]
- [x] 128-02-PLAN.md — CTC-04 long-prompt clamp + gradient fade + Read-more (independent) [D-03]
- [x] 128-03-PLAN.md — providerLogo.tsx shared helper (logo map + preparingDescription) + Wave-0 unit tests [D-05]
- [x] 128-04-PLAN.md — CTC-01 RunCard logo + TDP-02 ToolCallPanel description = the unified card (CTC-02) [D-01/D-04]
- [x] 128-05-PLAN.md — D-06 LIVE native-7+OpenRouter cross-provider scoreboard (operator-run) [D-06]
- [x] 128-06-PLAN.md — CTC-03 StickyTimerBar deletion (LAST, gated on the D-06 proof) [D-02/D-07]

**UI hint**: yes

#### Phase 129: MiniMax/OpenRouter Arg Repair

> **STRETCH-origin** — promoted to active 2026-06-26 after v3.1 CORE (120–124) shipped clean; selected as a highest-value STRETCH (the only one closing a live open bug).

**Goal**: Broader provider robustness — MiniMax malformed tool-args are repaired at the adapter boundary, and OpenRouter requests set `require_parameters` so a wider set of routed providers honor the tool schema.
**Depends on**: Phase 122 (extends the cross-provider trust cluster at the gateway/adapter boundary); CORE complete (gate lifted)
**Requirements**: MP-04 (STRETCH)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A MiniMax malformed-args response is repaired at the adapter boundary so the tool call still dispatches instead of failing (closes the `minimax-m3-invalid-tool-args-400` class).
  2. OpenRouter requests carry `require_parameters`, and the change improves tool-schema honoring without regressing other providers (SC#10), with provider handling staying at the adapter boundary (no shared-path fork).

**Plans**: 3 plans

- [ ] 129-01-PLAN.md — OpenRouter `require_parameters` wired into the quality strategy (D-02) + unit test
- [ ] 129-02-PLAN.md — MiniMax-gated arg-validity guard + bounded re-ask + recovered signal / honest-fail (D-01/D-03); folds BUG-260607-03 + unit tests
- [ ] 129-03-PLAN.md — SC#10 4-axis live cross-provider scoreboard (authored in VALIDATION.md + operator-run)

#### Phase 130: template_input Resolver Run-Scope

**Goal**: Defense-in-depth for the collision — the `template_input` resolver is run-scoped too, so the `render_template` path can't re-introduce a cross-run leak alongside the COLL-01 harvest fix.
**Depends on**: Phase 120 (pairs with COLL-01 on the same collision/harvest surface); gated behind CORE completion
**Requirements**: COLL-02 (STRETCH)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The `template_input` resolver only resolves inputs scoped to the current run — a prior run's template inputs in the shared workspace are never picked up by a later run's `render_template`.
  2. The render_template path produces the same output it did before for in-scope inputs (no regression on the happy path).

**Plans**: TBD

#### Phase 131: Non-Python Skill-Script Honesty

**Goal**: A user who imports or runs a market skill that bundles a non-Python script the Python-only sandbox can't execute (e.g. `.js`) gets an honest, specific signal instead of a silent/confusing failure — closing the trust gap from the 2026-05-31 JS-skill-import incident (SEED-044 Layer 1). This is the honesty precursor to v3.2's DISC-01 (the full Node-execution capability); it is purely additive and stays OFF the COLL-01 sandbox-injection seam.
**Depends on**: Nothing hard; sequence after Phase 120 only to avoid touching the COLL-01 harvest/execution seam concurrently. Gated behind CORE completion. Lightweight (G-3-adjacent — import-boundary detection + an execution pre-check + message; no Node runtime, no image rebuild, no shared-path fork).
**Requirements**: SRH-01 (STRETCH)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Importing a skill that bundles a non-Python script (e.g. `.js`) still succeeds, and the user sees an honest message that the skill includes a step the sandbox can't run yet while its instructions still work.
  2. When the agent would run a non-Python skill script, it fails cleanly with a specific message instead of silently running JS as Python and dying on a Python `SyntaxError`.
  3. (Optional) `read_skill_file` can return a bundled `.js` as reference text so the model can read/reason about it, without implying it can be executed.

**Plans**: TBD
**Note**: Real multi-language execution (Node in the image + language routing) is explicitly NOT this phase — that's v3.2 DISC-01, which must sequence after COLL-01.

**Guardrails firing (v3.1):**

- **G-2 sketch-first** on Phase 121 (IA-01), Phase 124 (WUX-01/02), Phase 127 (WUX-03), Phase 128 (CTC-01..04 — reframed 2026-06-27 from a non-visual TDP-02 into a visual chat-surface bundle) — all live UI / "feels like" surfaces. `/gsd:sketch` before `/gsd:spec-phase` / `/gsd:discuss-phase`. `sketch-findings-agentic-rag` already names the workflow run surface, the Workflows page, the phase timeline, and the composer.
- **G-5 hot files:** `backend/app/api/threads.py` (firing → extraction due — do NOT grow it; 120/121 touch its thread/composer surface), `context_window.py`/`agent_loop.py` trim path (CTX-01 origin filter in `_reconstruct_history`, CTX-03 trim-pin), `PhaseTimeline.tsx`/`PhaseCard.tsx` (shared with the live harness — re-run replay tests in 124/127), the gateway/adapter boundary (122/128/129).
- **SC#10 cross-provider** is an EVAL axis here (MP-03), not just manual UAT — flagged on every phase touching streaming / agent loop / provider routing / UI state (120, 121, 122, 123, 124, and the dependent STRETCH phases).
- **Red line:** never fork the shared path — provider differences stay at the gateway/adapter/sanitizer boundary (D-14). Deep Mode stays byte-identical; no new runtime.

## v3.0 Document Management — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-21

Full detail archived → **`.planning/milestones/v3.0-ROADMAP.md`** · requirements → **`.planning/milestones/v3.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`** · summary → **`.planning/MILESTONES.md`**.

11 phases (110, 111, 111.1, 112–119; incl. inserted embeddings phase 111.1), 46 plans, shipped + validated — **every phase passed verify-work + secure-phase + validate-phase** (live cross-provider UAT on the agent-tool / upload-path phases; no formal milestone audit). Turned the product's incidental document handling into a first-class, metadata-driven surface (M-Files Tier A): user-defined custom metadata with per-field confidence + audited manual override, configurable multi-provider embeddings (retires the OpenAI SPOF), metadata-driven "virtual folders" (a closed-registry filter-AST → parameterized-jsonb compiler + a no-DSL builder + an agent tool), typed document relationships (a leak-safe share-don't-fork core + panel + agent tool), suggest-then-confirm auto-classification, and a light governance-health view. 24/24 functional requirements delivered; `threads.py` untouched all milestone (G-5); near-zero new deps.

**Next:** v3.1 Workflow & Skill Studio — Trust, Clarity & Triggers (active above; decided scope in `.planning/research/v3.1-skills-eval/CONSOLIDATED-SCOPE.md`).

## v2.9 Workflow Studio — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-15

Full detail archived → **`.planning/milestones/v2.9-ROADMAP.md`** · requirements → **`.planning/milestones/v2.9-REQUIREMENTS.md`** · summary → **`.planning/MILESTONES.md`**.

CORE phases 097–104 (9 phases incl. inserted 101.1, 57 plans) shipped + validated — every CORE phase passed verify-work + secure-phase + live cross-provider UAT. Turned the v2.8 harness into an authorable capability: project/scope binding + server-side KB governance, workflow↔skill composition, ephemeral template upload + guaranteed cited template-fill with integrity gates, a reusable validation-gate library + an output-quality judge **hard-wall**, a Workflows page with NL authoring + read-only graph + 8-stage publish gauntlet, and a PM flagship content pack on the generic primitives.

**STRETCH 105–109 deferred to backlog** (never started — roadmap gated them on "ship only if CORE lands clean and budget remains"): SCHED-01 (scheduled triggers + budget caps), GRID-01 (citation-traceable grid renderer), GOV-02 (per-run provenance receipt), PLUG-01 (plugin-contract lock), ROLE-01 (operator/admin role tier). They roll forward as next-milestone candidates.
