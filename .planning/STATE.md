# Project State

> ⚠ **This file was RESET at the v4.6 close (2026-10-18)** — the ninth reset, same reason each time.

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-10-18)

**Core value:** The agent acts as an AI colleague — it knows your knowledge base, can run code, and
can be taught new behaviours (skills) that persist and can be shared.
**Current focus:** v4.7 Workflows You Can See and Start Anywhere. Roadmap created; phase 286 next.

## Solo running (operator, 2026-09-29)

Gemini is OUT and the agent bus is RETIRED. Claude builds and reviews everything; no independent
reviewer exists, so a phase closes `verification_mode: self-verified`, never `reviewed`.

---

## Current Position

Phase: 286 (Seams Before Features) — not started; roadmap created 2026-10-18 (8 phases, 286-293, 14/14 requirements mapped). Next: `/gsd:discuss-phase 286`. Migrations resume at 210.

---

## Milestone close (2026-10-18)

**v4.6 Pay It Down COMPLETED by hand:** archives in `.planning/milestones/v4.6-*` (ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS,
MILESTONE-AUDIT, STATE-at-close, phases/), tag `v4.6` (local, not pushed), 24/24 requirements, audit
`tech_debt`, no blockers, integration 9/9. Closed core 7 phase types / 1 emitter / **30 tools**.

## Production

Live at `4e767a3a2` (2026-10-16): phases 280-285, migrations 207-209 in cloud. Branch `develop`.

## Owed (operator)

- Confirm the Coolify rebuild from outside; run a logged-in production smoke test.
- 282: G4-4, G4-6 (needs an approved write), A1 LangSmith nesting, Add-form click-through.
- 281: G-4 rows A, C, D.
- Pre-close artifact audit: 39 open entries, almost all pre-v4.6 (`gsd-sdk query audit-open`).
- v4.6 public changelog line for the `GET /documents` envelope breaking change (R-06).
- Open bugs not named in v4.6 requirements: see `.planning/reported-bugs/` (`status: open`).
