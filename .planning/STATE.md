# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-27) + .planning/PRDs/v2.7.md (drafted 2026-05-12, scoped to Themes A+C+D+H for v2.7)

**Core value:** The agent acts as an AI colleague -- it knows your knowledge base, can run code, and can be taught new behaviors (skills) that persist and can be shared
**Current focus:** Phase 086 — streamsprovider-extension-panel-hooks

## Current Position

Phase: 086 (streamsprovider-extension-panel-hooks) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: Executing Phase 086
Last activity: 2026-05-28 -- Completed quick task 260529-0sc: Fix Phase 086 WR-04 (persist panel todo/task Maps to localStorage)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20 (v2.7)
- Prior milestones: v2.6 shipped 91 plans in 16 days (~5.7 plans/day)
- Average duration: ~12min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 083 | 3 | - | - |
| 084 | 5 | - | - |
| 085 | 5 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: (from v2.6 close)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- (v2.7 roadmap): 6 phases derived from 22 requirements; research consensus confirmed build order
- (v2.7 roadmap): G-5 mandated -- threads.py extraction is Phase 083, prerequisite for all new tools
- (v2.7 roadmap): G-2 fires for Phase 087 (Panel UI) -- sketch-before-plan mandatory
- (v2.7 research): ask_user requires Redis pub/sub for cross-worker safety (asyncio.Event fails with WORKER_COUNT=2)
- (083-03): Kimi thinking filter uses state-machine with _in_think_block; provider-gated on moonshot + deepseek
- (083-03): _SINGLE_MODEL_PROVIDERS frozenset classifies provider tiers for title gen model routing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 085 `ask_user` tool has the highest implementation risk in the milestone -- Redis pub/sub cleanup path needs explicit decision records during planning
- Phase 087 Panel UI requires sketch approval (G-2) before planning can begin
- Tool count budget: 16 existing + ~8 new = ~24 total; Google warns >20; consolidation into fewer tools with action parameters recommended during Phase 084/085 planning

### Phase 086 surface note — BUG-260528-01 fix (2026-05-28, commit 7d2b3d2)

Surfaced for Phase 086 (streamsprovider-extension-panel-hooks), which touches the same snapshot/reconcile/message-list surface:

- **What was fixed:** `GET /threads/{id}/snapshot` and `/messages` now filter `role='system'` rows (`.neq("role","system")`). Phase 085's `ask_user` tool persists prompt/response as durable `role='system'` rows (migration 048), but `MessageResponse.role` is `Literal["user","assistant"]` — serializing a system row raised `ResponseValidationError` → **500, thread won't load**. Regression guard added in `test_075_snapshot.py`.
- **Constraint for 086:** any reconcile/snapshot/message-list change MUST preserve this filter, or threads with ask_user history 500 on load again. The `panel.py` `/pending` query (raw asyncpg, scans system rows directly) is the separate path and is unaffected.
- **OPEN FOLLOW-UP for 086 to decide:** answered ask_user Q&A turns are NOT rendered in reloaded conversation history (no frontend renderer for `tool_calls[].kind='ask_user_*'`; `/pending` only surfaces *unanswered* prompts). If reloaded ask_user history should be visible to the user, Phase 086 owns building that renderer (+ widening the wire model) rather than filtering. See `.planning/reported-bugs/snapshot-500-on-system-role-askuser-rows.md`.
- Also cleaned 2026-05-28: 7 ask_user test-fixture threads purged from dev DB; 8 stale git worktrees pruned.
